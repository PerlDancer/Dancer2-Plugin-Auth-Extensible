=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible - extensible authentication framework for Dancer2 apps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A user authentication and authorisation framework plugin for Dancer2 apps.

Makes it easy to require a user to be logged in to access certain routes,
provides role-based access control, and supports various authentication
methods/sources (config file, database, Unix system users, etc).

Designed to support multiple authentication realms and to be as extensible as
possible, and to make secure password handling easy.  The base class for auth
providers makes handling C<RFC2307>-style hashed passwords really simple, so you
have no excuse for storing plain-text passwords.  A simple script called
B<generate-crypted-password> to generate
RFC2307-style hashed passwords is included, or you can use L<Crypt::SaltedHash>
yourself to do so, or use the C<slappasswd> utility if you have it installed.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Configure the plugin to use the authentication provider class you wish to use:

  plugins:
        Auth::Extensible:
            realms:
                users:
                    provider: Example
                    ....

The configuration you provide will depend on the authentication provider module
in use.  For a simple example, see
L<Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Config>.

Define that a user must be logged in and have the proper permissions to 
access a route:

    get '/secret' => require_role Confidant => sub { tell_secrets(); };

Define that a user must be logged in to access a route - and find out who is
logged in with the C<logged_in_user> keyword:

    get '/users' => require_login sub {
        my $user = logged_in_user;
        return "Hi there, $user->{username}";
    };

=head1 AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS

For flexibility, this authentication framework uses simple authentication
provider classes, which implement a simple interface and do whatever is required
to authenticate a user against the chosen source of authentication.

For an example of how simple provider classes are, so you can build your own if
required or just try out this authentication framework plugin easily, 
see L<Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Example>.

This framework supplies the following providers out-of-the-box:

=over 4

=item L<Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Unix>

Authenticates users using system accounts on Linux/Unix type boxes

=item L<Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database>

Authenticates users stored in a database table

=item L<Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Config>

Authenticates users stored in the app's config

=back

The following external providers are also available on the CPAN:

=over 4

=item L<Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::DBIC>

Authenticates users stored in a database table using L<Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC>

=back

Need to write your own?  Just create a new provider class which consumes
L<Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Role::Provider> and implements the
required methods, and you're good to go!

=head1 CONTROLLING ACCESS TO ROUTES

Keywords are provided to check if a user is logged in / has appropriate roles.

=over

=item require_login - require the user to be logged in

    get '/dashboard' => require_login sub { .... };

If the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page URL to
log in.  The default URL is C</login> - this may be changed with the
C<login_page> option.

=item require_role - require the user to have a specified role

    get '/beer' => require_role BeerDrinker => sub { ... };

Requires that the user be logged in as a user who has the specified role.  If
the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page URL.  If
they are logged in, but do not have the required role, they will be redirected
to the access denied URL.

=item require_any_roles - require the user to have one of a list of roles

    get '/drink' => require_any_role [qw(BeerDrinker VodaDrinker)] => sub {
        ...
    };

Requires that the user be logged in as a user who has any one (or more) of the
roles listed.  If the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the
login page URL.  If they are logged in, but do not have any of the specified
roles, they will be redirected to the access denied URL.

=item require_all_roles - require the user to have all roles listed

    get '/foo' => require_all_roles [qw(Foo Bar)] => sub { ... };

Requires that the user be logged in as a user who has all of the roles listed.
If the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page URL.  If
they are logged in but do not have all of the specified roles, they will be
redirected to the access denied URL.

=back

=head2 Replacing the Default C< /login > and C< /login/denied > Routes

By default, the plugin adds a route to present a simple login form at that URL.
If you would rather add your own, set the C<no_default_pages> setting to a true
value, and define your own route which responds to C</login> with a login page.
Alternatively you can let DPAE add the routes and handle the status codes, etc.
and simply define the setting C<login_page_handler> and/or
C<permission_denied_page_handler> with the name of a subroutine to be called to
handle the route. Note that it must be a fully qualified sub. E.g.

    plugins:
      Auth::Extensible:
        login_page_handler: 'My::App::login_page_handler'
        permission_denied_page_handler: 'My::App::permission_denied_page_handler'

Then in your code you might simply use a template:

    sub permission_denied_page_handler {
        template 'account/login';
    }

If the user is logged in, but tries to access a route which requires a specific
role they don't have, they will be redirected to the "permission denied" page
URL, which defaults to C</login/denied> but may be changed using the
C<denied_page> option.

Again, by default a route is added to respond to that URL with a default page;
again, you can disable this by setting C<no_default_pages> and creating your
own.

This would still leave the routes C<post '/login'> and C<any '/logout'>
routes in place. To disable them too, set the option C<no_login_handler> 
to a true value. In this case, these routes should be defined by the user,
and should do at least the following:

    post '/login' => sub {
        my ($success, $realm) = authenticate_user(
            params->{username}, params->{password}
        );
        if ($success) {
            session logged_in_user => params->{username};
            session logged_in_user_realm => $realm;
            # other code here
        } else {
            # authentication failed
        }
    };
    
    any '/logout' => sub {
        app->destroy_session;
    };

If you want to use the default C<post '/login'> and C<any '/logout'> routes
you can configure them. See below.

The default routes also contain functionality for a user to perform password
resets. See the L<PASSWORD RESETS> documentation for more details.

=head2 Keywords

=over

=item require_login

Used to wrap a route which requires a user to be logged in order to access
it.

    get '/secret' => require_login sub { .... };

=item require_role

Used to wrap a route which requires a user to be logged in as a user with the
specified role in order to access it.

    get '/beer' => require_role BeerDrinker => sub { ... };

You can also provide a regular expression, if you need to match the role using a
regex - for example:

    get '/beer' => require_role qr/Drinker$/ => sub { ... };

=item require_any_role

Used to wrap a route which requires a user to be logged in as a user with any
one (or more) of the specified roles in order to access it.

    get '/foo' => require_any_role [qw(Foo Bar)] => sub { ... };

=item require_all_roles

Used to wrap a route which requires a user to be logged in as a user with all
of the roles listed in order to access it.

    get '/foo' => require_all_roles [qw(Foo Bar)] => sub { ... };


=item logged_in_user

Returns a hashref of details of the currently logged-in user, if there is one.

The details you get back will depend upon the authentication provider in use.

=item get_user_details

Returns a hashref of details of the specified user. The realm can optionally
be specified as the second parameter. If the realm is not specified, each
realm will be checked, and the first matching user will be returned.

The details you get back will depend upon the authentication provider in use.

=item user_has_role

Check if a user has the role named.

By default, the currently-logged-in user will be checked, so you need only name
the role you're looking for:

    if (user_has_role('BeerDrinker')) { pour_beer(); }

You can also provide the username to check; 

    if (user_has_role($user, $role)) { .... }

=item user_roles

Returns a list of the roles of a user.

By default, roles for the currently-logged-in user will be checked;
alternatively, you may supply a username to check.

Returns a list or arrayref depending on context.

=item authenticate_user

Usually you'll want to let the built-in login handling code deal with
authenticating users, but in case you need to do it yourself, this keyword
accepts a username and password, and optionally a specific realm, and checks
whether the username and password are valid.

For example:

    if (authenticate_user($username, $password)) {
        ...
    }

If you are using multiple authentication realms, by default each realm will be
consulted in turn.  If you only wish to check one of them (for instance, you're
authenticating an admin user, and there's only one realm which applies to them),
you can supply the realm as an optional third parameter.

In boolean context, returns simply true or false; in list context, returns
C<($success, $realm)>.

=item logged_in_user_lastlogin

Returns (as a DateTime object) the time of the last successful login of the
current logged in user.

To enable this functionality, set the configuration key C<record_lastlogin> to
a true value. The backend provider must support write access for a user and
have lastlogin functionality implemented.

=item update_user

Updates a user's details. If the authentication provider supports it, this
keyword allows a user's details to be updated within the backend data store.

In order to update the user's details, the keyword should be called with the
username to be updated, followed by a hash of the values to be updated. Note
that whilst the password can be updated using this method, any new value will
be stored directly into the provider as-is, not encrypted. It is recommended to
use L</user_password> instead.

If only one realm is configured then this will be used to search for the user.
Otherwise, the realm must be specified with the realm key.

    # Update user, only one realm configured
    update_user "jsmith", surname => "Smith"

    # Update a user's username, more than one realm
    update_user "jsmith", realm => "dbic", username => "jjones"

The updated user's details are returned, as per L<logged_in_user>.

=item update_current_user

The same as L<update_user>, but does not take a username as the first parameter,
instead updating the currently logged-in user.

    # Update user, only one realm configured
    update_current_user surname => "Smith"

The updated user's details are returned, as per L<logged_in_user>.

=item create_user

Creates a new user, if the authentication provider supports it. Optionally
sends a welcome message with a password reset request, in which case an
email key must be provided.

This function works in the same manner as L<update_user>, except that
the username key is mandatory. As with L<update_user>, it is recommended
not to set a password directly using this method, otherwise it will be
stored in plain text.

The realm to use must be specified with the key C<realm> if there is more
than one realm configured.

    # Create new user
    create_user username => "jsmith", realm => "dbic", surname => "Smith"

    # Create new user and send welcome email
    create_user username => "jsmith", email => "john@you.com", email_welcome => 1

On success, the created user's details are returned, as per L<logged_in_user>.

The text sent in the welcome email can be customised in 2 ways, in the same way
as L<password_reset_send>:

=over

=item welcome_send

This can be used to specify a subroutine that will be called to perform the
entire message construction and email sending. Note that it must be a
fully-qualified sub such as C<My::App:email_welcome_send>. The subroutine will
be passed the dsl as the first parameter, followed by a hash with the keys
C<code>, C<email> and C<user>, which contain the generated reset code, user
email address, and user hashref respectively.  For example:

    sub reset_send_handler {
        my ($dsl, %params) = @_;
        my $user_email = $params{email};
        my $reset_code = $params{code};
        # Send email
        return $result;
    }

=item welcome_text

This can be used to generate the text for the welcome email, with this module
sending the actual email itself. It must be a fully-qualified sub, as per the
previous option. It will be passed the same parameters as
L<welcome_send>, and should return a hash with the same keys as
L<password_reset_send_email>.

=back

=item password_reset_send

L</password_reset_send> sends a user an email with a password reset link. Along
with L</user_password>, it allows a user to reset their password.

The function must be called with the key C<username> and a value that is the
username. The username specified will be sent an email with a link to reset
their password. Note that the provider being used must return the email address
in the key C<email>, which in the case of a database will normally require that
column to exist in the user's table. The provider must be able to write values
to the user in order for this function to store the generated code.

If the username is not found, a value of 0 is returned. If the username is
found and the email is sent successfully, 1 is returned. Otherwise undef is
returned.  Note: if you are displaying a success message, and you do not want
people to be able to check the existance of a user on your system, then you
should check for the return value being defined, not true. For example:

    say "Success" if defined password_reset_send username => username;

Note that this still leaves the possibility of checking the existance of a user
if the email send mechanism is failing.

The realm can also be specified using the key realm:

    password_reset_send username => 'jsmith', realm => 'dbic'

Default text for the email is automatically produced and emailed. This can be
customized with one of 2 config parameters:

=over

=item password_reset_send_email

This can be used to specify a subroutine that will be called to perform the
entire message construction and email sending. Note that it must be a
fully-qualified sub such as C<My::App:reset_send_handler>. The subroutine will
be passed the dsl as the first parameter, followed by a hash with the keys
C<code> and C<email>, which contain the generated reset code and user email
address respectively.  For example:

    sub reset_send_handler {
        my ($dsl, %params) = @_;
        my $user_email = $params{email};
        my $reset_code = $params{code};
        # Send email
        return $result;
    }

=item password_reset_text

This can be used to generate the text for the email, with this module sending
the actual email itself. It must be a fully-qualified sub, as per the previous
option. It will be passed the same parameters as L<password_reset_send_email>,
and should return a hash with the following keys:

=over

=item subject

The subject of the email message.

=item from

The sender of the email message (optional, can also be specified using
C<mail_from>.

=item plain

Plain text for the email. Either this, or html, or both should be returned.

=item html

HTML text for the email (optional, as per plain).

=back

Here is an example subroutine:

    sub reset_text_handler {
        my ($dsl, %params) = @_;
        return (
            from    => '"My name" <myapp@example.com',
            subject => 'the subject',
            plain   => "reset here: $params{code}",
        );
    }

# Example configuration

    Auth::Extensible:
        mailer:
            module: Mail::Message # Module to send email with
            options:              # Module options
                via: sendmail
        mail_from: '"My app" <myapp@example.com>'
        password_reset_text: MyApp::reset_send

=back

=item user_password

This provides various functions to check or reset a user's password, either
from a reset code that was previously send by L<password_reset_send> or
directly by specifying a username and password. Functions that update a
password rely on a provider that has write access to a user's details.

By default, the user to update is the currently logged-in user. A specific user
can be specified with the key C<username> for a certain username, or C<code>
for a previously sent reset code. Using these parameters on their own will
return the username if it is a valid request.

If the above parameters are specified with the additional parameter
C<new_password>, then the password will be set to that value, assuming that it
is a valid request.

The realm can be optionally specified with the keyword C<realm>.

Examples:

Check the logged-in user's password:

    user_password password => 'mysecret'

Check a specific user's password:

    user_password username => 'jsmith', password => 'bigsecret'

Check a previously sent reset code:

    user_password code => 'XXXX'

Reset a password with a previously sent code:

    user_password code => 'XXXX', new_password => 'newsecret'

Change a user's password (username optional)

    user_password username => 'jbloggs', password => 'old', new_password => 'secret'

Force set a specific user's password, without checking existing password:

    user_password username => 'jbloggs', new_password => 'secret'

=item logged_in_user_password_expired

Returns true if the password of the currently logged in user has expired.  To
use this functionality, the provider must support the C<password_expired>
function, and must be configured accordingly. See the relevant provider for
full configuration details.

Note that this functionality does B<not> prevent the user accessing any
protected pages, even if the password has expired. This is so that the
developer can still leave some protected routes available, such as a page to
change the password. Therefore, if using this functionality, it is suggested
that a check is done in the C<before> hook:

    hook before => sub {
        if (logged_in_user_password_expired)
        {
            # Redirect to user details page if password expired, but only if that
            # is not the currently request page to prevent redirect loops
            redirect '/password_update' unless request->uri eq '/password_update';
        }
    }

=back

=head2 PASSWORD RESETS

A variety of functionality is provided to make it easier to manage requests
from users to reset their passwords. The keywords L<password_reset_send> and
L<user_password> form the core of this functionality - see the documentation of
these keywords for full details. This functionality can only be used with a
provider that supports write access.

When utilising this functionality, it is wise to only allow passwords to be
reset with a POST request. This is because some email scanners "open" links
before delivering the email to the end user. With only a single-use GET
request, this will result in the link being "used" by the time it reaches the
end user, thus rendering it invalid.

Password reset functionality is also built-in to the default route handlers.
To enable this, set the configuration value C<reset_password_handler> to a true
value (having already configured the mail handler, as per the keyword
documentation above). Once this is done, the default login page will contain
additional form controls to allow the user to enter their username and request
a reset password link.

By default, the default handlers will generate a random 8 character password using
L<Session::Token>. To use your own function, set C<password_generator> in your
configuration. See the L<SAMPLE CONFIGURATION> for an example.

If using C<login_page_handler> to replace the default login page, you can still
use the default password reset handlers. Add 2 controls to your form for
submitting a password reset request: a text input called username_reset for the
username, and submit_reset to submit the request. Your login_page_handler is
then passed the following additional params:

=over

=item new_password

Contains the new automatically-generated password, once the password reset has
been performed successfully.

=item reset_sent

Is true when a password reset has been emailed to the user.

=item password_code_valid

Is true when a valid password reset code has been submitted with a GET request.
In this case, the user should be given the chance to confirm with a POST
request, with a form control called C<confirm_reset>.

For a full example, see the default handler in this module's code.
